# Python_Practice
The code is my progress in learning python through Coursera and Codecademy courses. 
- Basic python is done in Learning_Python.py
- Basic bioinformatics algorithms are covered in Bioinformatics_w_Python.py (Coursera: Biology Meets Programming: Bioinformatics for
Beginners from UC San Diego)
- Byopython is covered in Access_Bioinformatics_Databases_w_Biopython.py (Coursera: Access Bioinformatics Databases with Biopython)

The two certificates for these last two courses are shown below:
